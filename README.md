JavaTypeConversions
This repository contains three Java classes that demonstrate various type conversions and calculations:

Classes
1. TakeDoubleAndCastToInt
This class takes a double value as input from the user, casts it to an int, and prints the casted value.

2. TakeCharAndPrintASCIIValue
This class takes a char value as input from the user, converts it to its ASCII value, and prints the ASCII value.

3. TakeAgeAsInputAndConvertIntoSeconds
This class takes an int value representing age as input from the user, converts it to seconds (assuming 365 days per year), and prints the age in seconds.

Features
Type casting from double to int
Conversion of char to ASCII value
Calculation of age in seconds from years
Code Organization
Each class is a separate Java file, with its own main method and methods for taking input, performing conversions, and printing results.

Running the Code
To run the code, simply compile each Java file and execute the resulting .class file.

Java Version
This code is written in Java 8 and should be compatible with later versions of Java.
